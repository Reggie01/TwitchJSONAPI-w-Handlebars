My first version of the Twitch JSON API is at [codepen](http://codepen.io/Reggie01/pen/BoKYaw).

### User Stories
* I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
* I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
* If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
*  I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
